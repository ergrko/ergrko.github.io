        <h1> Eric Grant Kocharyan - Data Science (2022/23)</h1>
        
        <h3>Week 1</h3> 
        <p> The first task was to embed 2 automated and interactive charts onto my personal webpage.</p>
        <h3>Inflation in the United States of America</h3>
        <p>The first chart displays the year-on-year inflation level for the US (1963-2022)</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>The link between Firearm Deaths and Income in the US</h3>
        <p>The second chart illustrates the relationship between gun-related deaths and median income (by state and region).</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>

        <h3>Week 2</h3>
        <p> The second task was to build two live charts and embed them into my webpage. The first chart was run directly through an API, and the second chart was run directly from my Github account.</p>
    </div> 
</body>


<script>
    //Define charts:
    var myChart1 = "us_inflation.json";
    var myChart2 = "us_gun_dths_inc.json";

    // Embed charts:
    vegaEmbed('#Chart1', myChart1);
    vegaEmbed('#Chart2', myChart2);
