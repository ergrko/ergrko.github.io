        <h4>Aims of Project</h4>
        <p>Innovation is a crucial driver of economic growth and competitiveness. It allows businesses and countries to continuously improve and stay ahead in a rapidly-changing world.</p>
        <p>This project will analyse innovation trends over the past decade, as well as the relationship between innovation spending and its output. I will also examine the ease of innovation in different countries, and consider the role of talent in driving entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
        <p>Through this analysis, I hope to better understand the key drivers that contribute to a strong innovation ecosystem, and identify countries that excel or underperform in these areas.</p>

        <h4>Global Innovation; Trends during the last 10 years. </h4>
        <br><p>The <a href="https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator">'Global Innovation Index' (GII)</a> measures a country's capacity for and performance in innovation, using 81 indicators covering business sophistication, human capital, institutions and more. 
            Using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLdkX6TKyFB0r3nvRLfqAfsDcrNoQxM1#scrollTo=O7I5tcEEMrIf">Python</a> to clean the data from 2013-present, I created a map visualization showing the global trends in GII scores. </p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart1" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The map illustrates that the strongest innovation ecosystems are primarily located in North America, East Asia and Europe/Scandinavia, with Switzerland ranked first. The visualization also reveals China’s significant increase in GII scores, going from 44.7 to 55.3. USA, South Korea, Germany, and France also saw improvements in their scores. However, some countries that ranked highly in 2013 saw declines (e.g Canada, Scandinavia). </p>
        <p>To examine the relationship between innovation spending and GII scores, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B0hANv_VBIWGIV1Zy2pcorhmyEAljMPi#scrollTo=sgTW_H1YJ7ye">Python</a> to batch download API links from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS">World Bank</a> on changes in R&D expenditure for countries that saw large or minimal movements in the GII.</p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart2" ></div>
        <br><br><br><p>The line chart illustrates that countries with increases in their GII scores (China, USA, South Korea) also had increases in R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. Countries with falling R&D spending saw declines in their GII scores (Finland, UK). However, Belgium and Norway were exceptions, with R&D increases corresponding with declining GII scores. Thus, the relationship between innovation spending and its output requires further analysis. </p>
        <br><br>
        <hr style="color: black; border-style: groove; background-color: mediumturquoise;">
        
        
        <h4>Assessing the relationship between Innovative Spend and Output</h4>
        <br><p>Using World Bank data, I examined the relationship between <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS">R&D expenditure</a> and <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS">high-tech exports (as % of total exports)</a>. Using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cqkypr2iuAi2MmNDzIPPwVzngpk3dQtM#scrollTo=XJAonHBQalhS">Python</a>, I merged the R&D data with the exports data to help create a bubble chart visualization, with the bubble size representing <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TX.VAL.TECH.CD">exports in current US$</a>. To account for the lag between spending and output, I constructed a three-year average of R&D expenditure for each country (2015-2017-2019). </p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart3" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The chart shows a positive correlation between R&D spending and high-tech exports, with an R2 statistic of 0.13 suggesting 13% of the exports variation is explained by R&D expenditure. The Asian powerhouses (China, South-Korea, Singapore) seem to outperform their western counterparts, with China having a higher high-tech export percentage than the US, despite spending a lower percentage of GDP on R&D.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Next, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RyCGKE9ou_3yjsZwfdVGB-FUoa0H5hdx">Python</a> to scrape data on scientific publications from the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?year=2021&order=it&ord=desc">ScimagoJR</a> website. For better inferences, I used <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?most_recent_value_desc=true">World Bank</a> population data to construct a 'publications-per-million' statistic (ppm). </p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart4" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>By regressing R&D expenditure on 'ppm', I found a stronger positive correlation between innovative spending and this form of innovative output (R2 = 0.32). Switzerland had a notably high 'ppm' value and R&D statistic, which may explain its top rankings on the GII.</p>
        <br><p>Both charts demonstrate that innovation spending has an impact on innovative outputs, but other factors such as a country's ability to foster and encourage new ideas from its firms/citizens may also play a role.</p>
        <br><br>
        <hr style="color: black; border-style: groove; background-color: mediumturquoise;">

        <h4>The Ease of Innovation</h4>
        <br><p>To understand the ease of innovation in different countries, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DYIuOBryvv_Jx4aJ3Nszx4nGXYg57dGG#scrollTo=GHEWJulJSN-M">Python</a> to scrape data from a PDF covering the Economist's <a href="https://www.iberglobal.com/files/business_climate_eiu.pdf">'Business Environment Rankings'</a> (BER). This measure considers various factors central to business decisions, such as politics, competition, taxes and more. The chart shows the changes in BER ranks/scores for the 12 highest ranking countries over two periods in the 2010s decade.</p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart5" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The results are intuitive, with Singapore's 1st place ranking potentially explaining their strong 'High-Tech' export performance (chart3). Also, Switzerland's BER 2nd place rank further validates its high GII ranking (chart1).</p>
        <p>Venture Capital is good to consider, as these investments are usually for new ‘high-growth-potential’ businesses. To assess the potential link between business environment and VC, I used <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=VC_INVEST#">OECD data</a> to create a trellis chart displaying the trends in VC investments for 12 countries (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ha5oVSLy7w3K5CRUtTdu9eGALZG-CGlK#scrollTo=xTtEXFlZRaWP">Colab cleaning</a>).</p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6" ></div>
        <br><br>
        <p>Looking at both charts, countries with strong BER scores (Switzerland) or large rank movements (USA) showed large increases in VC investments. Conversely, countries with declining or slow-growing BER scores showed lower VC growth levels (Germany) or declines in VC (Sweden, Finland).</p>
        <br><p>Overall, the data suggests that a healthy business environment may support increased VC activity and innovation.</p>
        <br><br><hr style="color: black; border-style: groove; background-color: mediumturquoise;">

        <h4>Going Forward; Considering the 'Talent'</h4>
        <br><p>To assess the talent of different countries, I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZQ_Zle2UZAYEYmxmDUIYSq6Lcyt_IpLh#scrollTo=zl238mXsrzNK">scraped</a> data from <a href="https://www.webometrics.info/en/distribution_by_country#content">Webometrics</a>, to create a stacked bar chart visualization showing the number of top 1000 universities in countries hosting at least one top100 university.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The US dominates in terms of the quality and quantity of higher education institutions, with China, UK and Germany following. However, smaller countries such as Switzerland and Netherlands also perform well relative to their size when considering the top100 rank class.</p>
        <p>Next, I <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q4Nk86IMz791xY_NxaFEwiGMIhZbGSzx#scrollTo=pnOhn03fNad5">scraped</a> data on the ‘Global Entrepreneurship Index’ from the <a href="http://thegedi.org/global-entrepreneurship-and-development-index/">GEDI website</a>, and merged it with <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.CUAT.MS.ZS?most_recent_value_desc=true">World Bank data</a> on the percentage of individuals with a master's degree.</p>
        <br><br><div class="chart" id="Chart8" ></div>
        <br><br>
        <p>The resulting regression shows a positive correlation between higher-education attainment and entrepreneurship performance within a country, although the R2 statistic of 0.14 suggests a relatively weak relationship. Nevertheless, many countries with high GEI scores and proportions with master's degrees also performed well in the GII index, such as the US, Switzerland and Netherlands.</p>
        <br><p>Overall, these charts suggest the importance of investing in the youth to foster successful innovation.</p><br>
        <br><hr style="color: black; border-style: groove; background-color: mediumturquoise;">

        <h4>Concluding Statements</h4>
        <br><p>This project identified some of the key drivers behind innovation, such as R&D spending, the country’s business environment and education quality. I have highlighted how these factors contribute to the most innovative countries (Switzerland, USA, Singapore). The findings can be used to inform future research on innovation and to identify areas of improvement in ambitious countries.</p>

        <h4>Data Cleaning and Challenges</h4>
        <p>The biggest challenge I faced was scraping the data from Webometrics. I encountered a '403 forbidden error message' when using the pandas command 'pd.read_html,' so I imported the 'Beautiful Soup' package to inspect the website's elements and scrape the table. I then imported the 'Tabulate' package to convert the scraped data into a csv table and cleaned the data by converting it to long-form using the '.melt' command. </p>
        <p>Another challenge was making sure the visualizations were interpretable, as the base statistics for certain indicators would have created poor visualisations. So, I constructed a three-year average for R&D expenditure to reduce the likelihood of using an unusually low year and converted publications data to publications-per-million to account for population size. I also calculated the 2-year percentage change in venture capital data to filter out ‘year-on-year’ fluctuations. </p>
        <p>A common issue I encountered during data cleaning was the mismatch of names between data sources, such as for Figures 1, 3, 8. I dealt with this by; using the ‘match’ command in Excel to identify the problematic names between two datasets, then the ’.replace’ command in Python to change the names. </p>
        <p>I also had to deal with the issue of missing values (‘NaN’) for some countries. For instance, I chose the years 2015,2017 and 2019 for the average R&D statistic, because it had the least ‘NaN’ values and included the most important countries, such as Switzerland, who were problematic because the country published R&D data every two years. This primarily affected visualisations using World Bank and OECD data (Figures 3, 4, 6, 8).</p>
