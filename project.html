        <p>EDIT;'Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D), expressed as a percent of GDP. 
            They include both capital and current expenditures in the four main sectors: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit. 
            R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.' 
            EDIT; 'High-technology exports are defined as products with high R&D intensity, such as in aerospace, scientific devices, electrical machinery, computers, pharmaceuticals etc.
            Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology products may also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade. 
            The method takes only R&D intensity into account, but other characteristics of high technology are also important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents.'</p>
