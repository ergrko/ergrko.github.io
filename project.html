            Clearly, the continents/countries with the highest innovation rankings were .............</p>
        <p>I also decided to visualise the changes in R&D expenditure (as a % of GDP) for 9 prominent countries. The line chart shows that.... Clearly, most of the selected countries followed similar trajectories as their GII scores, with..... However, there were notable anomalies such as Norway and Belgium who saw declines in their GII score despite large increases in R&D investment (as % of GDP).....</p>
        <p>Thus the relationship between expenditures aiming to bolster innovation, and the actual output produced from this investment needs to be analysed.....</p>

        <p>EDIT;'Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D), expressed as a percent of GDP. 
            R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.' 
            EDIT; 'High-technology exports are defined as products with high R&D intensity, such as in aerospace, scientific devices, electrical machinery, computers, pharmaceuticals etc.
            Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology products may also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade. 
            The method takes only R&D intensity into account, but other characteristics of high technology are also important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents.'</p>

            At the end a reliable rank is only possible if the web presence is a trustworthy mirror of the university. 
            In the second decade of the 21st century the Web is key for the future of all the university missions, as it is already the most important scholarly communication tool,
