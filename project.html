        <h4>Aims of Project</h4>
        <p>Innovation is a crucial driver of economic growth and competitiveness. It allows businesses and countries to continuously improve and stay ahead in an increasingly globalised and rapidly-changing world.</p>
        <p>This project will analyse innovation trends over the past decade, as well as the relationship between innovation spending and its output. I will also examine the ease of innovation in different countries, and consider the role of talent in driving entrepreneurship and innovation.</p>
        <p>Through this analysis, I hope to better understand the key drivers that contribute to a strong innovation ecosystem, and identify countries that excel or underperform in these areas.</p>

        <h4>Global Innovation; Trends during the last 10 years. </h4>
        <br><p>The <a href="https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/analysis-indicator">'Global Innovation Index' (GII)</a> measures a country's capacity for and performance in innovation, using 81 indicators covering business sophistication, human capital, institutions and more. 
            Using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sLdkX6TKyFB0r3nvRLfqAfsDcrNoQxM1#scrollTo=O7I5tcEEMrIf">Python</a> to clean the data from 2013-present, I created a map visualization showing the global trends in GII scores. </p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart1" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The map illustrates that the strongest innovation ecosystems are primarily located in North America and Europe/Scandinavia, with Switzerland ranked first. The visualization also reveals Chinaâ€™s significant increase in GII scores, going from 44.7 to 55.3. USA, South Korea, Germany, and France also saw improvements in their scores. However, some countries that ranked highly in 2013 saw declines (e.g Canada, Scandinavia). </p>
        <p>To examine the relationship between innovation spending and GII scores, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B0hANv_VBIWGIV1Zy2pcorhmyEAljMPi#scrollTo=sgTW_H1YJ7ye">Python</a> to batch download API links from the <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS">World Bank</a> on changes in R&D expenditure for countries that saw large or minimal movements in the GII.</p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart2" ></div>
        <br><br><br><p>The line chart illustrates that countries with increases in their GII scores (China, USA, South Korea) also had increases in R&D spending as a percentage of GDP. Countries with falling R&D spending saw declines in their GII scores (Finland, UK). However, Belgium and Norway were exceptions, with R&D increases corresponding with declining GII scores. Thus, the relationship between innovation spending and its output requires further analysis. </p>

        <h4>Assessing the relationship between Innovative Spend and Output</h4>
        <br><p>Using World Bank data, I examined the relationship between <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS">R&D expenditure</a> and <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TX.VAL.TECH.MF.ZS">high-tech exports (as % of total exports)</a>. Using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Cqkypr2iuAi2MmNDzIPPwVzngpk3dQtM#scrollTo=XJAonHBQalhS">Python</a>, I merged the R&D data with the exports data to help create a bubble chart visualization, with the bubble size representing <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/TX.VAL.TECH.CD">exports in current US$</a>. To account for the lag between spending and output, I constructed a three-year average of R&D expenditure for each country (2015-2017-2019). </p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart3" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>The chart shows a positive correlation between R&D spending and high-tech exports, with an R2 statistic of 0.13 suggesting 13% of the exports variation is explained by R&D expenditure. The Asian powerhouses (China, South-Korea, Singapore) seem to outperform their western counterparts, with China having a higher high-tech export percentage than the US, despite spending a lower percentage of GDP on R&D.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Next, I used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RyCGKE9ou_3yjsZwfdVGB-FUoa0H5hdx#scrollTo=tCeGiMk483Va">Python</a> to scrape data on scientific publications from the <a href="https://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?year=2021&order=it&ord=desc">ScimagoJR</a> website. For better inferences, I used <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?most_recent_value_desc=true">World Bank</a> population data to construct a 'publications-per-million' statistic (ppm). </p>
        <br><div class="chart" id="Chart4" ></div>
        <br><br><br>
        <p>By regressing R&D expenditure on 'ppm', I found a stronger positive correlation between innovative spending and this form of innovative output (R2 = 0.32). Switzerland had a notably high 'ppm' value and R&D statistic, which may explain its top rankings on the GII.</p>
        <br><p>Both charts demonstrate that innovation spending has an impact on innovative outputs, but other factors such as a country's ability to foster and encourage new ideas from its firms/citizens may also play a role.</p>
