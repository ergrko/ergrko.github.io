        <p>EDIT;'Gross domestic expenditures on research and development (R&D), expressed as a percent of GDP. 
            They include both capital and current expenditures in the four main sectors: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit. 
            R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.' 
            EDIT; 'High-technology exports are defined as products with high R&D intensity, such as in aerospace, scientific devices, electrical machinery, computers, pharmaceuticals etc.
            Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology products may also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade. 
            The method takes only R&D intensity into account, but other characteristics of high technology are also important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents.'</p>

        <p>EDIT this info on measures used;'Web indicators are considered as proxies in the correct, comprehensive, deep evaluation of the university global performance, taking into account its activities and outputs and their relevance and impact.

            At the end a reliable rank is only possible if the web presence is a trustworthy mirror of the university. 
            In the second decade of the 21st century the Web is key for the future of all the university missions, as it is already the most important scholarly communication tool, 
            the future channel for the off-campus distance learning, the open forum for the community engagement and the universal showcase for attracting talent, funding and resources.   '</p>
