        <h1>Portfolio Project</h1>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h1>Week 1</h1> 
        <p> The first task was to embed 2 automated and interactive charts onto my personal webpage.</p>
        <h3>Inflation in the United States of America</h3>
        <p>The first chart displays the year-on-year inflation level for the US (1963-2022)</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>The link between Firearm Deaths and Income in the US</h3>
        <p>The second chart illustrates the relationship between gun-related deaths and median income (by state and region).</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"> </div>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <p> The second task was to build two live charts and embed them into my webpage. Both charts relate to IMF lending, with the second chart correcting for the failures of the first chart.</p>
        <h3>IMF lending (in Nominal terms)</h3>
        <p>The first chart shows the nominal value of IMF lending to all members been 1984-2022. However, in order to make our data more applicable, it needs to be transformed.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"> </div>

        <h3>IMF Lending as a % of World GDP</h3>
        <p>The second chart builds on the previous chart by dividing this nominal value of lending by global GDP, which helps present our raw data in a much better manner.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"> </div>
        <p>This chart shows that the IMF lent the most in 1984 (as a proportion of Global GDP), thus suggesting this was the riskiest year to invest in markets.</p> 
        <p>Notably, from the second chart it is clear that IMF lending (relative to GDP) followed a downward trajectory after 2000. This clearly contrasts to the message portrayed by the first graph, which showed that IMF credit payments increased in the same time frame. This validates why the data transformation was required.</p> 
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <p> The third task was to use Python (Google Colab) to convert data from a .csv file into dictionary format, to make a chart. Then, to create a second chart to improve on the visual endcoding.</p>
        <h3>Evolution of 4 former Soviet-states' GDP</h3>
        <p>This chart shows the trend of GDP per Capita in 4 former Soviet-states (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Uzbekistan) since gaining Independence from the USSR (1991). Included data for 1990 for better comparison.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"> </div>
        <p>......................</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"> </div>
        <p>The visual encoding was changed from a bar chart to a line chart. This was done to make the differences in GDP per capita between countries much clearer.</p>

        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <p> The fourth task was to use a scraper in Python to extract data from a website, to make a chart.</p>
        <h3>Average Premier League attendances</h3>
        <p>This chart shows each Premier League team's average matchday turnout during the 2021/22 season.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart7"> </div>
        <p>The data was scraped from <a href="https://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/eng-premier-league-2021-2022/1/">https://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/eng-premier-league-2021-2022/1/</a>. </p>
        <p>The website prevented me from directly scraping the data, therefore I had to find the table's element in the website's coding. Then, I copied the table's 'element' and created a seperate .html file on Visual Studio, which was then uploaded to Colab, for scraping and cleaning (click <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jqs_GL70LK1kYEGhOMeik0WsnKU65gaU">here</a> for link to Colab Notebook). </p>
        <p>I chose this site because the table was already in long-form('TIDY') format. Therefore, it was already machine-readable and clearly illustrated the data for the chart.</p>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h1>Week 5</h1>
        <p>The fifth task was to use the ONS API to batch download nine different series as JSON files.</p>
        <p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oHodF3CqAOWlrWqSyvuEHkq-Z9vUj2E_">Click here to access the python code behind these charts relating to the UK's Balance of Payments.</a></p>

        </div> 
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <h1>Week 7</h1>
        <p>The sixth task was to produce two maps and embed them into my website.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart17"></div>
        <p>This base map presents the World, with a clear outline for every country's borders. The map includes a country name tooltip. </p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart18"></div>
        <p>This choropleth map illustrates the life expectancy (at birth) across the globe. It shows both the country name and life expectancy value in the tooltip.</p>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h1>Week 8</h1>
        <p> The seventh task was to produce two charts that support/refute an argument made at the Festival of Economics.</p>
        <p> Sarah Smith spoke about how long-term inactivity has risen since Covid, thus resulting in labour market tightness and wage increases. Vicky Pryce added that the UK and US faced similar situations.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart19"></div>
        <p>......................</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart20"></div>
        <p>......................</p>
        <p> From the first chart, inactivity rates in the UK have steadily risen since Covid. Despite initial steep rises, the US saw gradual declines in inactivity. Focusing on the private sector, both nations are now seeing protracted increases in hourly earnings.</p>
        <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

        <h1>Week 9</h1>
        <p> The eighth task was to produce two charts that use advanced analytics.</p>


    </div>
